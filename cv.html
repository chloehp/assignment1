                     of Northampton. I’ve also been educated in design, illustration and image and photo manipulation in secondary and college.Through working as a waitress and bar tender at Wetherspoons and the Digey cafe I have gained valuable communication skills and shows how I am able to work well as
                     part of a team. From the age of 12 to 16 I was in the ATC, an organisation that serves as a youth group connected to the RAF. During my time in the ATC I gained the rank of corporal, was awarded the St John's ambulance first aid badge, and was
